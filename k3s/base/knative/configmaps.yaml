    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # ingress-class specifies the default ingress class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.
    #
    # Note that changing the Ingress class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    ingress-class: "istio.ingress.networking.knative.dev"

    # certificate-class specifies the default Certificate class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Cert-Manager Certificate.
    #
    # Note that changing the Certificate class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    certificate-class: "cert-manager.certificate.networking.knative.dev"

    # namespace-wildcard-cert-selector specifies a LabelSelector which
    # determines which namespaces should have a wildcard certificate
    # provisioned.
    #
    # Use an empty value to disable the feature (this is the default):
    #   namespace-wildcard-cert-selector: ""
    #
    # Use an empty object to enable for all namespaces
    #   namespace-wildcard-cert-selector: {}
    #
    # Useful labels include the "kubernetes.io/metadata.name" label to
    # avoid provisioning a certificate for the "kube-system" namespaces.
    # Use the following selector to match pre-1.0 behavior of using
    # "networking.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert" to exclude namespaces:
    #
    # matchExpressions:
    # - key: "networking.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert"
    #   operator: "NotIn"
    #   values: ["true"]
    namespace-wildcard-cert-selector: ""

    # domain-template specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the Knative service's DNS name. The default
    # value is "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}".
    #
    # Valid variables defined in the template include Name, Namespace, Domain,
    # Labels, and Annotations. Name will be the result of the tag-template
    # below, if a tag is specified for the route.
    #
    # Changing this value might be necessary when the extra levels in
    # the domain name generated is problematic for wildcard certificates
    # that only support a single level of domain name added to the
    # certificate's domain. In those cases you might consider using a value
    # of "{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}", or removing the Namespace
    # entirely from the template. When choosing a new value be thoughtful
    # of the potential for conflicts - for example, when users choose to use
    # characters such as `-` in their service, or namespace, names.
    # {{.Annotations}} or {{.Labels}} can be used for any customization in the
    # go template if needed.
    # We strongly recommend keeping namespace part of the template to avoid
    # domain name clashes:
    # eg. '{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{ index .Annotations "sub"}}.{{.Domain}}'
    # and you have an annotation {"sub":"foo"}, then the generated template
    # would be {Name}-{Namespace}.foo.{Domain}
    domain-template: "{{.Name}}.{{.Domain}}"

    # tag-template specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the DNS name for "tags" within the traffic blocks
    # of Routes and Configuration.  This is used in conjunction with the
    # domain-template above to determine the full URL for the tag.
    tag-template: "{{.Tag}}-{{.Name}}"

    system-internal-tls: "Disabled"

    # Controls the behavior of the HTTP endpoint for the Knative ingress.

    # - Enabled: The Knative ingress will be able to serve HTTP connection.
    # - Redirected: The Knative ingress will send a 301 redirect for all
    # http connections, asking the clients to use HTTPS.

    # autocreate-cluster-domain-claims controls whether ClusterDomainClaims should
    # be automatically created (and deleted) as needed when DomainMappings are
    # reconciled.
    #
    # If this is "false" (the default), the cluster administrator is
    # responsible for creating ClusterDomainClaims and delegating them to
    # namespaces via their spec.Namespace field. This setting should be used in
    # multitenant environments which need to control which namespace can use a

    #
    # If this is "true", users are able to associate arbitrary names with their
    # services via the DomainMapping feature.

    # If true, networking plugins can add additional information to deployed
    # applications to make their pods directly accessible via their IPs even if mesh is

    # Consumers like Knative Serving can use this setting to adjust their behavior
    # accordingly, i.e. to drop fallback solutions for non-pod-addressable systems.
    #
    # NOTE: This flag is in an alpha state and is mostly here to enable internal testing
    #       for now. Use with caution.
    enable-mesh-pod-addressability: "false"

    # mesh-compatibility-mode indicates whether consumers of network plugins
    # should directly contact Pod IPs (most efficient), or should use the
    # Cluster IP (less efficient, needed when mesh is enabled unless
    # `enable-mesh-pod-addressability`, above, is set).
    # Permitted values are:
    #  - "auto" (default): automatically determine which mesh mode to use by trying Pod IP and falling back to Cluster IP as needed.
    #  - "enabled": always use Cluster IP and do not attempt to use Pod IPs.
    #  - "disabled": always use Pod IPs and do not fall back to Cluster IP on failure.
